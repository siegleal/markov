Jealousy's an ugly word, but you don't seem to care
Converse behind my back, but now I'm here
Need no one to comply with me though everyone that I defeat
Don"t need you, fuck camaraderie, this rage will never go away
Hatred fuels my blood
I'll burn ya down (You can't help me)
One king to watch the horsemen fall
I'll fight 'til the end (I won't help you)
I can't trust anyone (See it in my eyes)
Now I can understand
It's sorrow that feeds your lies
Whoa, yeah!
You're on my back when the water gets too deep for you to breathe
A crutch for you that won't always be there
Hide in the dark another day
The fear in you is here to stay
So keep the fuck away from me and learn to trust the words I say
Hatred fuels my blood
I'll burn ya down (You can't help me)
One king to watch the horsemen fall
I'll fight 'til the end (I won't help you)
I can't trust anyone (Witness and see it in my eyes)
Now I can understand
Put faith in you for the last time
It's sorrow that feeds your lies
Huh! Yeah, yeah!
Running from me before I tear you down (Be afraid)
You chose the wrong side (It feels so right)
I won't help you, let you run away (Despise what you say)
Run towards the light exposing your soul (We won't be there by your side)
Salvation's dying (Somebody's crying)
We're all gone in the end
Sweet child we'll miss you
Whoa, so far away, far away
I can't trust anyone (Witness and see it in my eyes)
Now I can understand (Put faith in you for the last time)
It's sorrow that feeds your lies
Falling away
Can't buy back time
Burn it down anyways
I feel insane every single time
I'm asked to compromise
Cause I'm afraid and stuck in my ways
And that's the way it stays
So how long did I expect love to outweigh ignorance?
By that look on your face I may have forced the scale to tip
I'm not insane, I'm not insane
I'm not insane, I'm not - not insane
Come back to me, it's almost easy
(Said it all)
Come back again, it's almost easy
Shame pulses through my heart
From the things I've done to you
It's hard to face, but the fact remains
That this is nothing new
I left you bound and tied with suicidal memories
Selfish beneath the skin
But deep inside I'm not insane.
I'm not insane, I'm not insane.
I'm not insane, I'm not - not insane.
Come back to me, it's almost easy
(Said it all)
Come back again, it's almost easy
(You'll learn your lesson)
Come back to me, it's almost easy
(But first you'll fall)
Come back again, it's almost easy
Now that I've lost you it kills me to say
(Hurts to say)
I've tried to hold on as you've slowly slipped away.
I'm losing the fight.
I've treated you so wrong, now let me make it right.
(Make it all right)
I'm not insane, I'm not insane. Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha
I'm not insane, I'm not - not insane.
Come back to me, it's almost easy
(Said it all)
Come back again, it's almost easy
(You'll learn your lesson)
Come back to me, it's almost easy
(But still you'll fall)
Come back again, it's almost easy
